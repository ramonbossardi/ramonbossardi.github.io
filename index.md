<h1>Biography</h1>

 I am a post-doc and joined the [Adam lab](adamlabs.org) in 2020 to study the endothelial response to inflammation and the implications of the IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 pathway. I am committed to basic and translational research and have extensive knowledge and experience in molecular biology, with expertise in multifactorial disease studies and epigenetics mechanisms. I received my M.S. and Ph.D. from the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)](https://www.ufrgs.br/ppgendo/) in Brazil. [Johns Hopkins University](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/environmental-health-and-engineering/research-and-practice/faculty-research-interests/the-wang-laboratory-of-human-environmental-epigenomes) was where I completed my first post-doc, where I studied the epigenetic codes in stem cells, embryonic development, and imprinted genes in both human and mouse genomes. I was responsible for library generation for whole-genome methylation, next-gen sequencing.  
 My research focuses on better understanding the implications of changes in epigenetic mechanisms and the long-term effects of the vascular endothelium dysfunction that is a hallmark of human diseases and focuses on researching endothelial activation, leukocyte migration, and inflammation.
 To this end, I have been working with different techniques in the lab, which involve: RNA seq, bisulfite DNA sequencing, cell culture, immunofluorescence, scrna-seq. These projects involve analysis that I perform using R including the steps of reference genomes, gene annotation, expression analysis, differential expression analysis, data visualization, and interpretation.
