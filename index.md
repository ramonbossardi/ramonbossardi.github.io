I am a post-doc and joined the Adam lab in 2020 to study the endothelial response to inflammation and the implications of the IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 pathway. I am committed to basic and translational research and have extensive knowledge and experience in molecular biology, with expertise in multifactorial disease studies and epigenetics mechanisms. As a master's and Ph.D. student at the Department of Molecular Endocrinology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, I conducted research seeking a better understanding of the molecular basis of multifactorial diseases that comprise both genetic and environmental components, such as polycystic ovary syndrome and type 2 diabetes. These studies provided me with a strong foundation on clinical and translational research. Then I took an 18-month position as a postdoctoral at Dr. Zhibin Wang at Johns Hopkins University Department of Environmental Sciences, where I studied the epigenetic codes in stem cells, embryonic development, and imprinted genes in both human and mouse genomes. I was responsible for library generation for whole genome methylation, next-gen sequencing and collaborated with a PhD student, Suzanne Martos, on the bioinformatic analyses. This study provided me with the required expertise in mechanisms of gene expression modulation and with a strong foundation in bioinformatics of large genetic datasets. In 2016 I moved back to Brazil with the goal of starting a new research program. However, due to political instability and severe cuts in research funding, this program never started. So, I decided to come back to the US to continue my research path. I joined the Adam lab in 2020 to study the endothelial response to inflammation and the implications of the activation of the IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 pathway.
